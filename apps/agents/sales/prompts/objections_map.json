  "how did you get my number": "That’s a great question! We worked with your team earlier, so I’m following up to help. If it’s not a good time, I can send a quick summary and circle back.",
  "not interested": "Totally understand — may I ask what your priorities are right now? If I could show value in 2 minutes later this week, would that be worth it?",
  "busy": "No problem at all — I’ll send a concise summary and a calendar link. Is there a better time to reconnect?",
  "no budget": "Understood — most teams start on our low-cost plan with a free sandbox, then scale as needed. Shall I send options?",
  "send info": "Happy to — what’s the best email or WhatsApp? I’ll send a short note with relevant examples today."
